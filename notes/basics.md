# Basics

## CAMS
1. Culture
2. Automation
3. Measurement
4. Sharing

### Culture
DevOps is a human/culture/business problem

Dev and Ops got split and siloed.
So breaking down those walls is key

### Automation
Not **just about** automation, because People and then process have to come first.
But once you got those two down (Culture), you can get this done.

### Measurement
Metrics help us see whether we're improving or not
But how to choose the right metric and provide correct incentives?

Good things to look for:
* MTTR (Mean time to repair)
* Cycle Time
* Costs
* Revenue
* Employee Satisfaction

### Sharing
Openness and transparency which drives **kaizen** "discrete, continuous improvement"


## DevOps Principles: The Three Ways
### Systems Thinking
* Focus on the overall outcome of the entire pipeline || value chain
* instead of just optimizing one part of that chain at the expense of the overall result.
* You may just end up moving the bottleneck unexpectedly.
* Have to think holistically.
* Same goes for thinking about the organization as a whole.
* **From concept to cash!**

### Amplifying Feedback Loops
* Process that takes own output into consideration
* Short and effective are key
* The farther along a bug moves without getting caught, the more time wasted

### Culture of Continual Experimentation and Learning
* working code wins
* if it hurts do it more
* fail fast
